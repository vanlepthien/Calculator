# Calculator
Sample implementations of multi-base calculators

This project contains implementations of multi-based calculators.

## Projects

### *org.lepthien.calculator* 
This is the POJO calculator core. It is used by *org.lepthien.calculator.groovy* and *org.lepthien.calculator.swing* as their calculator engine. Currently, a fixed and a decimal calculator are implemented.

### *org.lepthien.calculator.groovy*
Uses *org.lepthien.calculator* to perform calculations.

### *org.lepthien.calculator.swing*
Uses *org.lepthien.calculator* to perform calculations.

### *org.lepthien.calculator.gwt*
I plan to have the back end use *org.lepthien.calculator*. This currently uses an internal BigInteger calculator.

### *org.lepthien.calculator.html*
A HTML/Javascript implementation.

### *org.lepthien.calculator.jsp*
Calculations are currently done by Javascript. In the future they will be performed on the server.

This calculator is still under development.
